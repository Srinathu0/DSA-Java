Types of Datastructres
1). Linear [Array, LinkedList, Stack, Queue] (data elements are arranged in sequential manner, 
    it is easy to traverse, stored in single level)
2). Non Linear [Tree, Graph] (data stored in multi level)

Time Complexity:
    Its amount of time taken by algorithm to run.

Space Complexity:
    Its amount of memory or space taken by algorithm to run.

Asymptotic Analysis: 
    - Asymptotic notation is a mathematical tool used in computer science to describe the behavior 
        of algorithms in terms of their running time or space requirements as the input size grows.
    - Asymptotic analysis helps in evaluating performance of an algorithm in terms of 
        input size and its increase.

Day 1 [022/02]:
Three types of notations:
(i).   Omega Notation: Its the formal way of to express the lower bound of an algorithm. running time.
       Lower bound [determines best amount of time an algorithm can take to complete].
(ii).  Big O Notation: Its the formal way to express the upper bound of an algorithm running time.
       Upper bound [determines the longest amount of time an algorithm can take to complete].
(iii). Theta Notation: Its the formal way to express both the upper and lower bound of an algorithm
       running time. It determines the average amount of time an algorithm can take to complete.
